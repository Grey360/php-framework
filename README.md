# php-framework
## Prerequisites
1. [PHP 7.1.2](http://php.net/releases/) : look for the **7.1.2 version** using `CTRL + F` and download the archive for **your OS**
2. [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/), whatever version.
3. Run `generate.sql` and `insert.sql`, in this order, by connecting to your local [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) server and running ths script once you are in.
4. Enabling the [MySQL PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php) extension in the `php.ini` file
5. Using the PHP integrated development server to expose our framework quickly:
`php -S localhost:9000`
6. In your browser, fetch `http://localhost:9000`
7. Enjoy the framework (...even suggest improvements?)
8. Contribute... Perhaps? (LEL)
